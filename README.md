# If you'd like to use this app yourself

This is specifically for the library template in Notion that lets you organize books. Get an API key for Google Books and put it in to the fetch on App.js. Run the server locally and you should be able to search for books (by title seems to work best) and download a CSV with the book's Title, Author(s), Page Count, and Image. The image loading into notion seems to be reiant on the machine running the notion app.
